#  SwiftEval - Yes, it's eval() for Swift

![Icon](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190m/10su/lectures/slides/images/drevil.png)

SwiftEval is a [single Swift source](SwiftEval/SwiftEval.swift) you can add to your iOS simulator
or macOS projects to implement an eval function inside classes that inherit from NSObject.
There is a generic form which has the following signature:

```Swift
extension NSObject {
	public func eval<T>(_ expression: String, _ type: T.Type) -> T {
```

This takes a Swift expression as a String and returns an entity of the type specified.
There is also a shorthand function for expressions of type String which accepts the
contents of the String literal as it's argument:

```Swift
	public func eval(_ expression: String) -> String {
	    return eval("\"" + expression + "\"", String.self)
	}
```

An example of how it is used can be found in the EvalApp example.

```Swift
    @IBAction func performEval(_: Any) {
        textView.string = eval(textField.stringValue)
    }

    @IBAction func closureEval(_: Any) {
        if let block = eval(closureText.stringValue, (() -> ())?.self) {
            block()
        }
    }
```

### implementation

The code works by adding an extension to your class source containing the expression.
It then compiles and loads this new version of the class "swizzling" this extension onto
the original class. The expression can refer to instance members in the class containing
the eval class and global variables & functions  in other class sources.

The command to rebuild the class containing the eval is parsed out of the logs of the last
build of your application and the resulting object file linked into a dynamic library for
loading. In the simulator, it was just not possible to codesign a dylib so you have to
be running a small server "'signer", included in this project to do this alas.

### Code Injection

Included is a simple implementation of ["code injection"](SwiftEval/SwiftInjection.swift).
If you are stopped in a class, you can edit the class' implementation, save it and type
"p inject()". Your changes will be applied without having to restart the application.
To detect this in your code to reload a view controller for example, subscribe to the
"INJECTION_BUNDLE_NOTIFICATION".

### But Why?

I Guess it could be useful in a DSL or something? You never know.
